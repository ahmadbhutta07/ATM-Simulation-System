# ATM-Simulation-System (CLI-Based)

A Python-based ATM Simulation System that supports user authentication, Balance Checking, and withdrawals. It allows only three attempts for the user, which protects your account from unauthorised access. If any unauthorised person attempts to access your account without your permission, your account will be locked after 3 attempts.
The system uses a menu-driven approach implemented with loops and match-case, ensuring continuous interaction until the user chooses to exit. It also includes security features like limited login attempts and account blocking after three incorrect PIN entries. Additionally, the program handles validation for transactions and provides a low balance warning when funds drop below a defined threshold.
